Server Time :D

Background Info:

 	Calendars are stored locally on the client's computer as event.dat

 	On the client's computer a file timestamp is also stored which contains when the calendar event.dat was last updated.

 	For each user that has made an account there are two files on the server:
	 	1. A file titled with the users name that contains the user's password and the last time the file was updated on the server.
	 	2. A file title with the users name with a .dat extension that contains a copy of the user's 

Instructions:
	
	When the program begins you will be prompted whether or not you want to skip straight to the Ciscolendar or access the server.

	If you access the server you have three options: signup or login (or alternatively exit).

	If you signup an account is made for you on the server and you select a username and password.

	If you login, you will be prompted for your username and password. If you enter those correctly, your calendar is compared with the one on the server and the less recent one is replaced with the more recent one.

	Once you have selected your prompt and completed the action, you go straight to the ciscolendar.
