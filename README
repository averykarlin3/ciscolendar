Using ciscolendar
	

///////////////////
Make a process(char* user, char* command) - Takes a command, does whatever a calendar does

On server: ~/.data/user
On client: ~/.cal

Note on Server-Client:
	At start, reconciles system
	Commands change only on server, and read only from server
	Save command takes from server
	Client is able to do some commands alone

Look for the processing comment in client and server for the processing function
Look for the user comment in the client and server for any user functionality

DIfferences between client and server:

Server able to store multiple users
Client able to store single user
Otherwise same functionality
