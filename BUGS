Known Bugs:

1. The server often needs to be restarted for additional client to connect to it and the server sometimes has trouble connecting to a new client after the old one left.

2. Occasionally, the code will start having trouble connecting to 217.0.0.1. (This only started very recently. It started occurring after one of the above errors; There was no change in code before it started happening.)
