Known Bugs:

1. Sometimes there is an error in the client connecting to the server. I donâ€™t think this is a specific result of our code, but rather just something that occasionally happens when attempting connections. Our code handles this by exiting and returning an error.

2. The server often needs to be restarted for additional client to connect to it and the server often has trouble connecting to a new client after the old one left.

3. Rarely, but occasionally, the client will randomly stop connecting to the server and restarting and even recompiling the code does help. Restarting the terminal fixes this.

4. This is less of a bug and more a user-friendliness thing we did not implement: the code does not handle connecting to an invalid IP address well.
