Known Bugs:

1. Sometimes there is an error in the client connecting to the server. I donâ€™t think this is a specific result of our code, but rather just something that occasionally happens when attempting connections. Our code handles this by exiting and returning an error.

2. The code does not handle connecting to an invalid IP address well.

3. The server often needs to be restarted for additional client to connect to it and the server sometimes has trouble connecting to a new client after the old one left.
