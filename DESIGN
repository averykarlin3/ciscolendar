The Project:

The project is a Google Calendar type software. A main server will store a calendar along with all of the information on it (e.g. birthdays, holidays, important reminders). The user can navigate the calendar and view different dates, months, etc. and add/view/remove events for specific days. Users can create/access individual calendars. Users can either access calendars stored on the server via a login system or their own local ones.

Features Implemented:

In our client/server system and the calendar we worked with a lot of user-inputted data (e.g. fgets). In our client/server system and the calendar we also worked with files a lot (e.g. reading, writing, lseek, etc.) and we used a lot of tools for working with strings (e.g. strcmp, strcat, etc.).  We also unsurprisingly used a significant amount of networking and all that that neccessitates in the client and server system.
