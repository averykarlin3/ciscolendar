The Project:

The project is a Google Calendar type software. A main server will store a calendar along with all of the information on it (e.g. birthdays, holidays, important reminders). Users can create/access either individual or group calendars and there will be a login system to determine which calendars the user can access. Users can add special dates to the calendar and add reminders which will be sent to the user at a certain time or when some event happens. We'll likely also add permissions to the group calendars (i.e. certain users can only access/change certain things).

Features Implemented:

We'll definitely use a lot of working with files and accessing information about them because we need those tools to store the calendar information and form the permission system. We will also use pipes, networking, and some signals and processes techniques to form the server-client system.

Intial Layout/Jobs:
Haoran - General Calendar funcationality and reminder system
Matthew - Login, permission system, and file-related features
Avery - Server-Client System
